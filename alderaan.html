	<h1>Alderran</h1>
	<h2>A dead planet, but with a colorful history.</h2>

	<p class="paragraph">When we state that the planet is dead, we don't mean that it is just like Tatooine; a vast wasteland of desert. We mean we caused the planet to no longer exist after we blew it up. We didn't want to resort to blowing up Alderran, but the rebellion gave us no choice. They were plotting to use the planet as a means of building up a large enough strike force to attack the Emperor!</p>

	<p class="paragraph">We could have collaborated with Alderran, in order to make their section of the galaxy far more safer than what it was. We could have also strengthened the government through establishing military and economic ties to help the planet and its people recover from occupation from the Resistance movement. We could have advanced into the future, hand in hand, knowing that we would have each others back when a rogue planet or resistance movement threatened our livelihoods.</p>

	<p class="paragraph">Moving on from the sad and depressing part we switch gears to inform you that you still have multiple opportunities with Alderran to learn and grow in the name of the Imperial State.</p>
