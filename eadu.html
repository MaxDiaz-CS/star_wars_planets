	<h1>Eadu</h1>


	<h2>A quiet place for opportunities of research and innovation</h2>


	<p class="paragraph">With a climate insuitable for a <em>permenant</em> rebel hideout; Eadu provides many opportunities for anyone wanting to become well rounded in the functions of the imperial government or military. Anyone who is also enjoys watching and working with the weather, is also encouraged to visit Eadu. With these multipe opportunites to rise through the ranks of the imperial hierarchy; you might be able to even meet our glorious Emperor or Chief of Staff themselves.</p>


	<p class="paragraph">Even though this planet is full of opportunity, it is not for the faint hearted. Even though it is safe from a full-blown counter-attack by any rebel scum; there have been times when an assasin or two were able to infiltrate our headquarters. Another fault within our system, is the weather itself. The base may be safe, but the journey is perilous. The weather is ever changing, from light rain to hurricane like conditions. Again, this planet is only for the most ambitious and bravest of the brave.</p>
