				<h3> Ewok Attack on Shield Base !</h3>
				<h6>09/08/3018</h6>
				<p class="paragraph">According to Ewok legend they say He has returned to Endor. A golden god that came from the sky and told tales of mystical
					wars, and of a force that binds the whole universe together. A whole lot of malarkey that no doubt some rebel Droid Spewed to them, probably to save some rebels from being eaten by those savage beasts. In other news, there was a small skirmish this week outside the Sheild Generator base stationed on Endor. The savage fluffy bears and their rebel scum conspirators were naturally defeated with minimal losses. Only a pair of Speedbikes were destroyed. The sheild generator is down for minor repairs, but should be operational before any rebel attack is imminent. Importantly a great victory was scored in the capture of rebel leader Luke Skywalker, who will be interogated and will reveal the location of strategic rebel bases in need of destroying

				<h3>Opportunities Abound on Endor !</h3>
				<h6>08/15/3018</h6>
				<p class="paragraph">
					To those who are thinking about getting stationed on Endor, if you come from planets known for desert, this might be a welcome change of pace. This place is bright and green and a quiet location in the galaxy. The only thing really of importance is our sheild generator, but the rest of the planet is generally a quiet beautiful place where in the off times you can get out and read under a tree, or lay in a hammock between trees at night. Even better make portions over a campfire with friends. To those interested in ecology and wildlife there seem to be a race or 2 of primitive sentient beings that one of which are called the Ewoks. They seem to fear everyone and are agressive, and are known for their boobytrapping, so stay alert when tracking and viewing this interesting race.
